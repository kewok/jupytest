    "# Introducing individual-based modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual-based models (sometimes called \"Agent-based models\") are an approach to understanding complex phenomena (like evolution) in which each individual organism is simulated explicitly. The basic idea is to understand how system behaviors emerge from the action of several individuals. A classic example of how system behaviors emerge from individual actions is collective motions in schools of fish:\n",
    "<img src=Pics/F1.large.jpg>\n",
    "Each individual fish moves according to a set of rules of what its neighbor does, and out of the actions of many individual fish, we see how the behavior of the school emerges."

    "In fact, we've already been exposed to a simple individual-based model with AVIDA-Ed. Each individual \"Avidian\" is born, reproduces and dies, and out of their collective births, deaths and mutations, after many generations the evolutionary dynamics of the plate as a whole \"emerges\". However, as we reflected on Tuesday, there are inherent limitations to AVIDA-Ed - for instance, individual movement of organisms is hard to simulate, reproduction is asexual,  multitrophic interactions are not accounted for, there are no other species, etc... There is therefore a pretty limited scope for exploring richer topics if we want to understand the evolution of organisms other than bacteria on limited petri dishes."

    "Today, we are going to try to explore how we can build a basic individual-based model for studying evolution. Our goals are very simple: we will first explore how we can characterize individuals using Blockly. We will then perform some basic operations on these individuals repeatedly over time. The key to working on the Blockly exercises today is to __nest__ - that is, we will work with \"lists of lists\" and \"loops of loops\". Take a moment and jot down in the cell below what you think that means. Remember the Markdown tags &lt;mark&gt;!"

    "A word about Blockly this week. Since we will be working in an incremental manner and building towards a final simulation, it would be a good idea to work in a single Blockly workspace/environment rather than have a bunch of separate workspaces. The latter will require you to duplicate a lot of effort, and unfortunately there is no easy way in Blockly to copy and paste across workspaces.\n",

    "## Creating individuals in a population\n",
    "To create an individual, the magic of what we are going to do will involve creating an individual as a \"list of lists\" - that is, an individual will consist of a list of two other lists: their genotypes and their phenotypes. Let's assume that the list of genotypes has 5 elements, with the ith element of the list being equal to the allelic value at locus i, and three phenotypes. So, go ahead and run the cell below, create a list \"genotypes\" with five elements and a list \"phenotypes\" with three elements, and see if you can create a list called \"individual 1\" consisting of these two lists."

Like all problem solving exercises, using computers to study evolution boils down to figuring out how to break a difficult problem down into smaller components, solving each of those components, and then putting your solutions back together again to solve the bigger problem. What you saw today was that through variation of loops and lists, you were able to construct a pretty sophisticated simulation of an evolving ecosystem. Nice job!"

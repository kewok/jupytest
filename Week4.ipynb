    "\n",
    "The \"rational\" thing for a person to do in the prisoner's dilemma is to \"defect\" (or \"cheat\"). If you defect, then best case scenario, your partner stays silent (\"cooperates\") and you get $\\$ 5$. In the worst case scenario, your partner also defects, and you both get $\\$1$. However, if you were to stay silent and cooperate with your partner, then if your partner defects, you will get nothing. Even if your partner cooperated, you will still only get $\\$3$. If you don't know what your partner is going to do, then your expected earnings if you cooperate are $3 \\times 0.5 + 0 \\times 0.5=\\$1.5$, while your earnings if you defect are $5 \\times 0.5 + 1 \\times 0.5=\\$3$. Clearly, if your goal is to maximize your earnings and you believe your partner is equally likely to defect as to cooperate, you should defect.\n",

    "\n",
    "As with last week, you can go ahead and plan to work in a single workspace for working on this exercise. This will save you from having to do a lot of cutting and pasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we're going to do is provide a calculation of the payoff matrix in the form of a *function*. The basic idea of a function in programming works much like it does in mathematics: it's a way that you take an input, do some stuff on that input, and produce an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions must first be defined. Go ahead and click on the Functions tab, and choose the block with the words \"to do something/return\" . Then, name your function \"calculate_payoff\". Because we are defining a payoff matrix function, what are the two inputs that you think are appropriate for your function? Go ahead and click on the blue settings button, and put the two input values you will likely need. You can name them whatever you want as long as the two arguments have different names (\"x,y\", \"my_pretty_flower, your_burnt_burger\", etc... but not, for instance \"red_line, red_line\"). Still, often it helps to name them something that makes sense in terms of what kind of inputs you're thinking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's actually calculate the payoff. Let's first create a variable inside this function called \"payoff\" and set it to zero. Zero will be our \"default\" payoff. How do we calculate what this payoff should be? This is where we can use a trick called control flow. If you click on the logic button, there is a block \"if do\". What you want to do is place this logic block inside of your function. Select the blue settings bar and add an entry for \"else\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to __nest__ our logic (there's that nesting again!). Put another \"if do\" block inside the if part of your first \"if do\" block and another inside the else part. Now, you want to specify out what the value of the payoff variale needs to be in terms of your two input variables. Then, return the payoff variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see if your function works, try creating three variables: output, and two input variables. Assign the two input variables an arbitrary value. Then, set your output variable equal to the value that is returned by the \"caluclate_payoff\" block with your two inputs. Print that output value to make sure you have done this correctly."
